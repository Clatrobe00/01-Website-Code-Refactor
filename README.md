\# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

In this project I have refactored the index.html and style.css files for the Horiseon Marketing Webpage. 

This project is a digital media marketing page that includes link elements in the nav bar that allow the user to scroll down to the content below.

I have refactored the HTML and CSS files for this webpage, adding semantic elements, best practices, and fixing broken code.

The project is deployed live at the following URL: https://clatrobe00.github.io/01-Website-Code-Refactor/

Here is an image of the functioning site:

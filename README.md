# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

In this project I have refactored the index.html and style.css files for the Horiseon Marketing Webpage. 

I have added semantic elements to html and improved organization of the code. I have also added relevant alt attributes to all the images on the page to improve accesibility and search engine optimization.

I have fixed the HREF link to scroll down to the Search Engine Optimization article.

I have consolidated CSS selectors into a more logical organization and assigned class and IDs to appropriate elemtns.

If you click the links in the nav bar, you will find the page scrolls down to the relevant article.
